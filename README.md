# Fun With Go

This is just my "fun with Go" repository to experiment with ideas to get use
to the ideas that I could use in a larger scale, long running service.

# TODO

I plan to implement the following ideas so far:

* Fan-in examples
* Request-response examples
* Subscription cleanup examples

The above techniques were discussed in Google I/O talks on Go Concurrency
from 2012 (Rob Pike's talk) and 2013.

# Notes

Really this is just for me, but don't mind sharing at all.
